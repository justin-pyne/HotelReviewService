# Project 1
For this project, you will design and implement data structures that store information about hotels and hotel reviews, and support efficient search. The data is in JSON files that were obtained from the Expedia API.  Your will practice using the following:
-	Working with JSON files and GSON library
-	Traversing a directory
-	Using nested data structures from the Collections framework for efficient search.
-	Object-oriented design

You are required to use the provided starter code (including directory structure and input files) and IntelliJ IDEA for this project; do not modify the signatures of methods in starter code, do not modify tests, yml file, or input files.  You will need to add more classes and methods. Do not place all of your code in the main method of the HotelReviewService class; this would be a poor design.
You may not use external libraries except fo GSON and JUnit.
Your code will be evaluated based on the functionality, efficiency and design.
Please see the description of the project in pdf and the link to the starter code on Canvas.
